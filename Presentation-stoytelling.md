My presentation will be about my experience in graphic design. I also remember my mistakes and problems that I had when I working with clients. 
As you can see from one of my most common mistakes, I didn't save my work many times. Well let's drop it now...<br/>

I have a big family, and my nephew didn't want to do homework, that's why it started with one drawing, and it didn't end.
His teacher start to believe that my nephew really drew well. It was a lie, I wanted to stop helping them, but my mom pushed on me, that I must to help them, again and again. 
Also I had to draw like a child, that's why this paintings are so imperfect.<br/>

I selected only the pictures that I found on my laptop. But I don't have here one an important picture, it was also his homework. That picture was sent to the competition and like not me, but my nephew won the second place in this competition. I was glad, that my drawing wasn't so bad.<br/>

I don't even remember how the neighbors found out, that I could draw. They also have a boy who didn't want to draw homework for school. They came for me and I drew a New Year forest. At that moment I understood, that I couldnÂ´t say NO to anyone, and that drawing for children was so easy. I started to like it. I was like a Yes man.<br/>
